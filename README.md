# Javascript Calculator

JavaScript calculator that uses immediate excecution logic for input logic.
The app is built as to fulfill `user stories` from **freeCodeCamp**, you can check them out here: [Build a JavaScript Calculator](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator)

## Design credit
I’m not the author of the design, I’ve found a concept design on dribbble.com and recreated it with CSS.

## Motivation
While building the app my goal was to practice following concepts/technologies:
* React, React Hooks
  * keyboard events
* CSS / SASS
  * Recreating the design from the photo using CSS
