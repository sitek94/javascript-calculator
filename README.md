# Javascript Calculator

See the project live: https://sitek94.github.io/javascript-calculator/

JavaScript calculator that uses immediate execution for input logic. Additionally I practiced recreating a really cool design from dribbble.

The app is built as to fulfill `user stories` from **freeCodeCamp**, you can see them here [link to user stories](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator).

Some additional functionality:
* square root
* plus/minus sign
* double zero
* delete last digit

## Design credit
I’m not the author of the design, I’ve found a concept design on dribbble.com and recreated it with CSS. 
You can check it out here: [Calculator design byJaroslav Getman](https://dribbble.com/shots/2334270-004-Calculator)

## Motivation
While building the app my goal was to practice following concepts/technologies:
* React, React Hooks
  * keyboard events
* CSS / SASS
  * Recreating the design from the photo using CSS
